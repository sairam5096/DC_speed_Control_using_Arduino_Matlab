# DC_speed_Control_using_Arduino_Matlab
this work describes a Simulink lab practices using ARDUINO as low cost hardware. These ARDUINO boards are used to perform a specific task by means of embedded C programming in ARDUINO IDE and also be programmed by using Simulink in MATLAB. By using ARDUINO boards we can implement the modern control techniques like P, PI, and PID. This can be further implemented to electrical appliances to get an effective control in devices. By using developer boards we can have communication with mobile using Bluetooth modules or by WIFI or Ethernet cable to connect to internet also. By applying this technology to machines, we can achieve smooth control on machines. These boards are capable of doing projects. In this project we are going to implement the PID control technique for a permanent magnet DC motor (because it is more efficient, more reliable and easy to control compared to the field wound motor). By using MATLAB software we can get the exact results in this project. It is very useful to students and non technical persons. By using this software we can easily write the program with basic knowledge of C and embedded C languages. In this paper by using PWM technique we control the speed of permanent magnet DC motor
